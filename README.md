âœ… **Simple and Expressive Syntax**  
Designed to be easy to learn, Xylon maintains the power and flexibility needed to build robust applications.

âœ… **Intelligent Internal Translator**  
Code written in different languages is automatically converted into a standardized internal format before execution, ensuring consistency and preventing conflicts between natural languages.

âœ… **Flexible for Various Applications**  
Xylon can be used for developing everything from small scripts to complex systems, covering areas such as web development, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.

#### ðŸš€ **Code Example in Different Languages**

```xylon
// Code in Portuguese
variavel idade = 25;
se (idade > 18) {
    escreva("Maior de idade");
}

// Code in English
variable age = 25;
if (age > 18) {
    print("Of legal age");
}

// Code in German
variable alter = 25;
wenn (alter > 18) {
    schreiben("VolljÃ¤hrig");
}
```

âž¡ All these examples work exactly the same, thanks to Xylonâ€™s built-in translator!
